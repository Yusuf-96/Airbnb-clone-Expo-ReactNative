So it's peaceful, yet close to city. There are a few cafes and bars.  My favourite are Horizon, All you Read is Love.  The Marrakech (next door to Sainsbury) is also nice and reasonably priced.  All have free wifi.  All have nice cakes! Red Lion pub is opposite the Horizon Cafe on Leytonstone High Road.  Quite nice food (bit over-priced in my opinion), but great area out the back with cinema screenings. Shops/food, main ones are: -Sainsbury - right outside the tube station, about minute away.  Open till 11pm -Asian 24 hour supermarket - right opposite the tube station as you come out -Tesco 24 hour supermarket - Gainsborough Road, behind McDonalds which is on Leytonstone High Road. Wanstead is close-by with lots of shops bars, cafes and restaurants.  It's about a 15 minute walk.",

I got married to Hiram in February.  I think we are getting divorced!!\r\n\r\nI enjoy meeting new people and have had visitors now for 4 years.  I am from the UK, but lived in NZ for 26 years, and a short spell in Australia, but it was a bit hot and humid for me!  I am recently married (Feb 2013) to a Kenyan who lived in Italy for 8 years.  I am a book fiend and my house has stacks of them, as well as my kindle!  Although most are for my work.  I just started book collecting too.  So now I have an excuse for the obsessive collecting!  \r\n\r\nI enjoy a wide range of music, and am learning to play the violin!  Next will be keyboard.  I recently did a film-making course and looking forward to doing something with that!  I love learning.\r\n\r\nMy mottos are:  \r\nSeize the day;\r\nSeek the wisdom of the ages, but look at the world through the eyes of a child;  \r\nThink big thoughts, but relish small pleasures;\r\nForget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will\r\n\r\nA lot I know!  That's me, lots going on!",

The famous Portobello Market is just a three minute walk from the flat, selling antiquities, clothes and street-food. The area is a hub of traditional English pubs, cool bars and quality restaurants. It is also very central making it easy to access other parts of London. Notting Hill is a relaxed and safe area where you will feel comfortable walking home from the tube station at night. There is so much choice on Portobello Rd, and below are just a few of my favourite places to eat and drink. In the flat, there are many more recommendations, complete with maps showing you exactly how to get there. Butter Bakery : right across the road, has a brilliant selection of pastries for breakfast or a snack, with aromatic coffee and fresh juices. Ripe Tomato : a family-run restaurant just round the corner which serves fantastic Italian food. Make sure you leave room for pudding!  Raoul",

Unfortunately we cannot allow dogs (even though we love them!)",

There are also plenty of buses if you prefer the scenic route. I have been travelling round London my whole life so if you want to know the best way to get somewhere, just ask me! From the flat you can easily get to: Portobello Market (3 min walk) Madame Tussauds (15 mins by tube) Kensington Palace (20 min walk) Hyde Park (20 min walk) Buckingham Palace (30 min by tube) Natural History Museum (20 min by bus) Science Museum (20 min by bus) Kings Cross St Pancras (15 min by tube) Oxford Street (30 min by bus) Soho (35 min by bus) Harrods (30 min by tube) Westminster Abbey / Big Ben (25 min by tube) St Paul\u2019s Cathedral (30 min by tube) The London Eye (35 min by tube) Tate Modern /",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Angel is a trendy, fast paced neighbourhood, you will really feel like you are part of the city. That said, there are quiet spaces, such as garden pubs, and parks nearby. You will be spoilt for choice with hundreds of restaurants and bars lining Upper Street, some of them run and owned by top chefs such as Jamie Oliver. My flat is a 2 minute walk from all of this. There is also a shopping centre 5 minutes away with a 6 screen cinema and more shops and restaurants. Also a 5 minute walk away is one of the oldest street markets in London, Chapel Market. Here you can buy fruit, vegetables, clothing, hardware, hats, bags, more or less anything really. The market is full of real London characters. It's also worth mentioning we have fabulous theatres such as The Almeida, Hen & Chickens, and The Kings Head, all a stone's throw from here.  Angel is also the location of a pub called The Camden Head, the only comedy venue in London which has free comedy shows, every night of the week.",
        "notes": "The building is Grade II listed, and was founded in 1828, formerly The Royal Free Hospital, to provide free hospital care to those who couldn't afford treatment. The title 'Royal' was granted by Queen Victoria in 1837 in recognition of the hospital's work with cholera victims. It's a beautiful building, particularly imposing from the front, with many interesting architectural features. The conversion to housing was completed 20 years ago and was celebrated by the Royal Duchess of Wales who came to hold the opening ceremony. To this day the square is regarded as a flagship development of its kind, and sometimes visited by groups of tourists on historical tours.",
        "transit": "You can hire cheap bikes on the street outside the property. This facility was put in place by previous London mayor Boris Johnson as a way to get people out of their cars. It's a good way to explore the area. Cycling to the West End from here would take about 20 minutes. If cycling is not your thing, then Angel Tube Station is a 6 minute walk and will take you to all London destinations. Also outside the tube station are many different buses which will take you all over London including to Piccadilly Circus, Camden, Knightsbridge, West End, and the stations Kings Cross, Victoria, Euston and Waterloo. Handy if you need to catch a train out of London. All buses are frequent, some as often as every 3 minutes.",

I've been to the states, Caribbean, Kenya, Gambia and Thailand.\r\n\r\nOne of my favourite books is The Prophet by Kahil Gibran, which is a kind of dummy's guide to living, but told through the wise words of a very wise fictional prophet.\r\n\r\nHaving me as a host I think you will feel taken care of, as I love to do my best to help and assist, and make any recommendations, and would generally try to make your stay as enjoyable and comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\nMy life motto is that everything you go through is part of a bigger picture that you may never get to see. Knowing this really helps when something doesn't make sense. And I use this knowledge to trust that everything is working out for the greater good.",

We are very relaxed and love to have lots of people in the house.\r\n\r\nPeter works for Tesco, which is the UK's biggest retail store, covering groceries, furniture, toys, gas/petrol/diesel and almost everything else. Michelle works within healthcare / pharmaceuticals and as a university lecturer/tutor. The kids go to school...\r\n\r\nWe love to travel, although we do less flights these days as the kids are still small. We have been to the US (we lived in Boston for 6 years), Canada (Peter was born in Toronto), Mexico, Guatamala, Belize, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru and Brasil in the Americas. In Asia, we have visited Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Burma (for a day!). Africa is close to Michelle's heart, as she lived in Kenya for a year. We have also spent time in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa and Mali. Writing out this list makes me realise how lucky we are to have visited so many amazing places. We have also spent time in many European countries.\r\n\r\nMichelle's life motto: \"Today is not a dress rehearsal, it's the real thing. Live it.\"\r\n\r\nWe will be out of town over the Olympic season, but would like others to enjoy the fun!",

I am happy to write and answer specific queries to ensure my guests feel happy and comfortable and get the most out of their stay.  I expect guests to be kind, nice and polite in their interaction with me and this is what you can expect from me too.  If there is something wrong with the flat, for example the clenliness or the facilities, I expect my guests to let me know when they find this and BEFORE they leave so that I am able to resolve the problem. Airbnb has been a fantastic experience for me most of the time. I have loved sharing my first ever home with my guests (with two notable exceptions!).",

We ensure that noise  (Music, TV and conversation) is kept to a minimum after 23:00. My housekeeper cleans the flat most Wednesday afternoons between 13:00 and 16:00. Her responsibility is to do a maintenance clean and not to wash up or clean up after guests. I expect guests to leave the flat in the same condition that they found it when they arrived with the exception of the set(s) of sheets and towels and the kitchen T towels that you use immediately before your departure. Before you depart, please strip your sheets from the bed(s) and fold the sheets and put the towels into the large grey pop up bag you will find in the bedroom cupboard.

There are dozens of caf\u00e9s nearby catering to all palates and budgets. I'm gay, but very straight-friendly :-) I'm a nice guy and I'm happy to help you in any way I can to make your stay more enjoyable. I've lived in central London most of my adult life and I'm happy to advise on things to see and do. I've created a whirlwind two-hour circular walking tour covering many of the major sights that I can send you on (or perhaps even join you on) - first-time visitors to London usually love it. And it certainly doesn't take much to persuade me to join you in the pub! If three of you are staying and you don't all want to share the king bed, there is a single floor mattress that can be set up next to it.

When you book, you'll receive an automated email with detailed arrival instructions from all London airports and by Eurostar, as well as lots and lots of insider tips - it's well worth a careful read before you get here. I can also organise a licensed minicab pickup from the airport that's much cheaper than getting a taxi when you arrive - just ask.",

In general you won't have access to elsewhere in the apartment, so no kitchen or lounge access, but you'll have your own keys and can come and go as you please. I also rent a second room in the apartment, it is smaller with a separate shared bathroom - to see it, click my name to view my profile, then at the bottom of the left column click \"Double bed in Covent Garden / Soho\".",

I will try to work with you on mutually agreeable check-in and check-out times. If you have exact timescales in mind, please agree them with me before confirming your booking. Arrival after 11.30pm (scheduled or actual, and when possible and agreed) is an additional \u00a325. Bag storage and/or checkin before midday, when possible and agreed, is an additional \u00a310; similarly, checkout after midday and/or bag storage for later collection, when possible and agreed, is an additional \u00a310.

I've also stayed in Brazil, Finland, France, Kenya, Spain and the USA as an Airbnb guest. I'm gay, vegetarian, politically left-wing and I believe in social justice and equality, And I do like a drink sometimes, so if you want someone to show you the pubs of London, you've come to the right profile! I'm a massive Arsenal fan, I go to every home match as a season ticket holder, and if you're here during a home match there's a chance I can get you tickets too given enough notice. Harry Potter's showing at the end of my block, I may be able to help with Cursed Child tickets too. Since 2016 I've been on a massive health kick, I've lost over 55 lbs / 25 kgs, in part by walking five miles every day. If you wanna join me on one of these walks, just ask - I'm always looking for company!",

A great local tip is to download the Citymapper app. This free app will plan your journey for you efficiently and quickly.

My little house is the centre of my world. When I'm in London I work from here most weeks and have rehearsals and meetings. It's a shame when I go away and it falls silent for weeks on end...\r\n\r\nSo come in, take a look around, and if you'd like to bring some life back into it, please get in touch!\r\n\r\nTori",

I got married to Hiram in February.  I think we are getting divorced!!\r\n\r\nI enjoy meeting new people and have had visitors now for 4 years.  I am from the UK, but lived in NZ for 26 years, and a short spell in Australia, but it was a bit hot and humid for me!  I am recently married (Feb 2013) to a Kenyan who lived in Italy for 8 years.  I am a book fiend and my house has stacks of them, as well as my kindle!  Although most are for my work.  I just started book collecting too.  So now I have an excuse for the obsessive collecting!  \r\n\r\nI enjoy a wide range of music, and am learning to play the violin!  Next will be keyboard.  I recently did a film-making course and looking forward to doing something with that!  I love learning.\r\n\r\nMy mottos are:  \r\nSeize the day;\r\nSeek the wisdom of the ages, but look at the world through the eyes of a child;  \r\nThink big thoughts, but relish small pleasures;\r\nForget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will\r\n\r\nA lot I know!  That's me, lots going on!",

I'm a chilled out host who lets guests get on with their holiday or stay in peace, but always available for a chat or a local pick up from station or info on getting around town or the area. Two cats live here too. Nice cats. \r\n\r\nFive things I cannot live without are my MacBook Pro, my iPhone, poetry books and novels, fresh fruit and veg for juicing. I like the sights and sounds of London, particularly South Bank, theatre and spoken word poetry nights, the cinema and the parks. I love Kenya, Nairobi, Mombasa and the Masai Mara. I like Spain such as Barcelona, Madrid, Granada, the mountains of Andalusia and the Alpujarras. Ibiza's fun, even without the clubbing as the beaches are brilliant. I also like St Lucia, Guyana and New Zealand. Would love to travel to Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico, New York, LA, maybe Miami, Tanzania, Thailand.",

        "neighborhood_overview": "My place is within 5 minutes walking distance to Canary Wharf and 15 minutes from London City airport by DLR. The area itself dates back hundreds of years and you can find many historic streets, reflecting the old docklands, among the modern architecture. It is well worth taking a walking tour of the area and visiting near by historic pubs and restaurants such as the Prospect of Whitby and The Gun .  The Propect of Whitby stakes a claim to the title of London's oldest riverside pub whilst the The Gun is one of London's finest water-side restaurants. The area has fantastic shops and restaurants and is well connected by great transport links to other interesting parts of London such as the area around Tower Bridge and the City of London.",
        "notes": "Th apartment does not have parking. There is limited street parking in the vicinity for resident permit holders except for weekends, evenings and public holidays.",
        "transit": "Most amenities are in easy walking distance of my place including the Jubilee Line and DLR stations at Canary Wharf, Blackwall, Poplar etc.  There are frequent buses if you don't want to walk or take the tube or DLR.  The River boat service is within a 5 minute walk from my place to Canary Riverside.  The Riverboat is a great way to see London.  Another great way to see London is the Emirates Air Line Cable Car ride which will take you across the river to North Greenwich and the O2 with its restaurants and bars and can be reached within 10 minutes from my place by DLR from Blackwall station.  The views from the cable car are amazing.  You can visit historic maritime Greenwich, including the Cutty Sark and the Observatory by using the foot-tunnel near Island Gardens DLR station to cross the river Thames by  foot.  Island Gardens is about 10 minutes by DLR from my place.",
        "access": "When you stay at my place you can make use of the entire apartment for your entire stay.  There will be fresh milk, bread, tea, coffee etc waiting for you in the well equipped kitchen. So feel free to cook up a meal if you don't want to eat out or order in every night.  There is a large Waitrose and a small Tesco in Canary Wharf to pick up fresh ingredients and supplies. But you can always pop down to The Gun pub and restaurant which is just round the corner on Coldharbour Lane, 3 minutes walk from my place.",

I have lots of eating and drinking tips for those who book with me.  Hyde Park is walking distance, as is Kensington where you can find the high street for shopping, plenty more restaurants and cafes, as well as the Royal Albert Hall, the V&A Museum, the Natural History Museum and so much more. If you love shopping, Oxford Street is just a few stops on the tube or 10 minutes on the bus, and you can get to Westfield Shopping Centre in White City in 15 minutes.

        "neighborhood_overview": "Notting Hill is one of the most iconic areas of London and is without a doubt the ideal place to stay in London. The famous Portobello Market is just a stone's throw from the flat, selling antiquities, clothes and street-food. The area is a hub of traditional English pubs, cool bars and quality restaurants. It is also very central making it easy to access other parts of London. Notting Hill is a relaxed and safe area where you will feel comfortable walking home from the tube station at night. There is so much choice on Portobello Rd, and below are just a few of my favourite places to eat and drink. In the flat, there are many more recommendations, complete with maps showing you exactly how to get there. Butter Bakery : right across the road, has a brilliant selection of pastries for breakfast or a snack, with aromatic coffee and fresh juices. Ripe Tomato : a family-run restaurant just round the corner which serves fantastic Italian food. Make sure you leave room for pudding!  Raoul\u2019s :",
        "notes": "The flat is on the top floor, and there are quite a few staircases to climb, and no elevator access. This does mean it is very quiet though! If you have a buggy, this can safely be left on the first landing (we know all the other tenants so it will be safe.)",
        "transit": "Westbourne Park station is a five minute walk, and takes you to areas such as Paddington, Baker Street, Euston Square, Kings Cross/St Pancras and Liverpool Street.  Notting Hill Gate station is a ten minute walk, and from there you have a choice of three underground lines, taking you almost anywhere in London!  There are also plenty of buses if you prefer the scenic route. I have been travelling round London my whole life so if you want to know the best way to get somewhere, just ask me! I suggest you get an Oyster Card as soon as you get to London, for easy travelling. From the flat you can easily get to: Portobello Market (3 min walk) Madame Tussauds (15 mins by tube) Kensington Palace (20 min walk) Hyde Park (20 min walk) Buckingham Palace (30 min by tube) Natural History Museum (20 min by bus) Science Museum (20 min by bus) Kings Cross St Pancras (15 min by tube) Oxford Street (30 min by bus) Soho (35 min by bus) Harrods (30 min by tube) Westminster Abbey / Big Ben (25 min by tube)",
        "access": "The entire flat is for our guests' use. I will come and meet you and hand over the keys, and answer any questions you have.  If you are checking in after 6pm, I ask that you come to my house first to collect the keys (my house is on the same road as the flat, just 5 mins walk away) Please do not smoke in the flat. I ask that you treat the flat as you would your home. I am happy for you to have friends over for a meal, and enjoy the flat but please leave it clean and tidy. Unfortunately we cannot allow dogs (even though we love them!) The building contains other flats where working Londoners live, so we do ask that you are quiet during the evening.",
        "interaction": "I live and work just down the road, and will be happy to assist you with any needs. Check in is 2pm and check out is 11am however I can be flexible depending on availability, so just ask and I will try and accommodate where possible.",

Please do not put sauce pans, frying pans or sharp knives in the dishwasher. Please do not turn off the WiFi router, or the plug in which the router sits.",

A big fan of Netflix - means I hardly ever go to the cinema :)\r\n\r\nI have been lucky to travel to a few places around the world - South Africa and Kenya being my favourites. I have personally used Airbnb for a short vacation in the UK and absolutely loved it, 'am really hoping to welcome people to my home and give them a great experience and probably absorb myself into new cultures.",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Notting Hill is one of the most iconic areas of London and is without a doubt the ideal place to stay in London. The famous Portobello Market is just a stone's throw from the flat, selling antiquities, clothes and street-food. The area is a hub of traditional English pubs, cool bars and quality restaurants. It is also very central making it easy to access other parts of London. Notting Hill is a relaxed and safe area where you will feel comfortable walking home from the tube station at night. There is so much choice on Portobello Rd, and below are just a few of my favourite places to eat and drink. In the flat, there are many more recommendations, complete with maps showing you exactly how to get there. Butter Bakery : right across the road, has a brilliant selection of pastries for breakfast or a snack, with aromatic coffee and fresh juices. Ripe Tomato : a family-run restaurant just round the corner which serves fantastic Italian food. Make sure you leave room for pudding!  Raoul\u2019s :",
        "notes": "The flat faces the front of the building. The road is not particularly busy (and there is a big front garden between the flat window and the street) but it is on a bus route so if you are a particularly light sleeper, this might disturb you in the night. The stairs up to the platform bed are quite steep.",
        "transit": "Westbourne Park station is a five minute walk, and takes you to areas such as Paddington, Baker Street, Euston Square, Kings Cross/St Pancras and Liverpool Street.  Notting Hill Gate station is a ten minute walk, and from there you have a choice of three underground lines, taking you almost anywhere in London!  There are also plenty of buses if you prefer the scenic route. I have been travelling round London my whole life so if you want to know the best way to get somewhere, just ask me! I suggest you get an Oyster Card as soon as you get to London, for easy travelling. From the flat you can easily get to: Portobello Market (3 min walk) Madame Tussauds (15 mins by tube) Kensington Palace (20 min walk) Hyde Park (20 min walk) Buckingham Palace (30 min by tube) Natural History Museum (20 min by bus) Science Museum (20 min by bus) Kings Cross St Pancras (15 min by tube) Oxford Street (30 min by bus) Soho (35 min by bus) Harrods (30 min by tube) Westminster Abbey / Big Ben (25 min by tube)",

If you are checking in after 6pm, I ask that you come to my house first to collect the keys (my house is on the same road as the flat, just 5 mins walk away) The building contains other flats where working Londoners live, so we do ask that you are quiet during the evening.",
        "interaction": "I will come and meet you with keys (before 6pm - if you arrive after 6pm I might ask that you collect the keys from my house which is on the same road, depending on my availability). I live and work just down the road, and will be happy to assist you with any needs. Check in is 3pm and check out is 10am however I can be flexible depending on availability, so just ask and I will try and accommodate where possible.",

I have a passion for colour, culture and all things unique and interesting, and I enjoy visiting museums and exhibitions as I am always looking for things to inspire me. I have two daughters in their early twenties. One has flown the nest, while the other is at University so is back home in the holidays. \r\nI enjoy travelling and visiting new places. The last place I went to was Sicily. but i love India, Kenya & America. Best of all Rome, where I go often. \r\nI love the cinema and boxed sets. I am watching Homeland and The Americans at the moment and can't wait for the new season of Parenthood. I love Max. I think I am sounding  like a real loser. \r\nI wish I was more sporty but I do at least do Yoga twice a week. I like food and am a good cook particularly of Italian food having lived in Italy for many years. \r\nI love to read most of all and have just finished The Interestings by Meg Wollitzer. I like American writers, Joyce Carol Oates, Saul Bellow, Phillip Roth, AM Holmes.  \r\nI love beautiful houses and my favourite thing of all is finding things at junk shops.\r\n\r\nI am usually quite cheerful and laid back and I think you will like staying here. It has a nice homely and relaxed atmosphere at the same time as being clean and quiet.  \r\n\r\nI don't have a motto but generally I think 'just do it'.",

We also love Neilson activity holidays and staying at our holiday home in Ireland.\r\nI support a charity in Kenya sponsoring children to attend school. I visit every year to do teacher training and enjoy some winter sun.\n In my spare time I like walking pilates, swimming, playing Bridge and meeting up with friends for dinner.\r\n \r\nI can speak basic Greek, French and Spanish (much better at reading than speaking )\r\nJohn is fluent in French.",

I travel quite a lot for work, so I have an empty, lush, one bedroom apartment a lot of the time. When I travel, I like to stay with local people and avoid hotels at all costs, so I like to open up that possibility to people coming to Nairobi and wanting to stay somewhere different and experience the city from another point of view. I live in a one bedroom in a block of flats with a mixed community of young people, families, Indian, Kenyan, Middle Eastern... There is a kindergarten downstairs, and the best view in town. If you fancy some city living, this is the place for you.",

My little house is the centre of my world. When I'm in London I work from here most weeks and have rehearsals and meetings. It's a shame when I go away and it falls silent for weeks on end...\r\n\r\nSo come in, take a look around, and if you'd like to bring some life back into it, please get in touch!\r\n\r\nTori",

I am relaxed and friendly, busy but rarely frantic unless I am trying to finish and assignment in which case I am a flapping panick of a person! pottering is more my style.\r\n\r\nI don't need much, a good shower, a nice view, delicious 100% cooton sheets and I always prefer gas cooker being a chef. I Don't much need hair dryers and microwaves and so on so I as a guest I am pretty easy and as a host you might want to consider bringing your own hair dryer - microwaves could be tricky :-)",

Read my reviews - nearly everyone talks about the location. Guests often tell me I've undersold it, and despite what I wrote they still can't believe the location when they're here. Lots of listings claim they're central. You've found one that actually is :-) Absolutely ideal for tourists - all of the following are within a ten minute walk: British Museum, National Gallery, Covent Garden Piazza, Soho, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, the River Thames, Oxford Street, Regent Street, Carnaby Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, and all the major West End theatres. Harry Potter fans: The Cursed Child is under a minute's walk away, and visible from my front door. It's bustling with life during the day, but surprisingly quiet at night - all the nearby pubs close at 11pm and the late-night clubs and bars, whilst close enough for you to easily walk",

There are dozens of caf\u00e9s nearby catering to all palates and budgets. It's thanks to Airbnbers like you that I was recently able to afford an amazing new boiler, with heating on-demand so the hot water never runs out. It's situated in this bedroom, since gas boilers these days must be directly connected to an external vent. It's about as modern and quiet as it's possible for a boiler to be, but you will hear it clicking into life sometimes. I'm gay, but very straight-friendly :-) I'm a nice guy and I'm happy to help you in any way I can to make your stay more enjoyable. I've lived in central London most of my adult life and I'm happy to advise on things to see and do. I've created a whirlwind two-hour circular walking tour covering many of the major sights that I can send you on (or perhaps even join you on) -",

When you book, you'll receive an automated email with detailed arrival instructions from all London airports and by Eurostar, as well as lots of insider tips - it's well worth a careful read before you get here. I can also organise a licensed minicab pickup from the airport much cheaper than getting a taxi when you arrive. Any questions, please ask me.",

So far I've hosted over 800 guests from countries including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA and Uruguay. I've also stayed in Brazil, Finland, France, Kenya, Spain and the USA as an Airbnb guest. I'm gay, vegetarian, politically left-wing and I believe in social justice and equality, And I do like a drink sometimes, so if you want someone to show you the pubs of London, you've come to the right profile! I'm a massive Arsenal fan, I go to every home match as a season ticket holder, and if you're here during a home match there's a chance I can get you tickets too given enough notice. Harry Potter's showing at the end of my block, I may be able to help with Cursed Child tickets too. Since 2016 I've been on a massive health kick, I've lost over 55 lbs / 25 kgs, in part by walking five miles every day. If you wanna join me on one of these walks, just ask - I'm always looking for company!",

Where we are is a lovely blend of a countryside English feel, yet only 25 minutes from our door to Leicester Square and the West End, and we love the peace of home and the convenience of being 3 tube stops from Victoria. \u2022 This area is also known as Little Portugal and there is a great community of shops nearby, with a deli up the road 4 mins walk away selli",

You won't be disappointed - it has been voted the best private market in the UK! \u2022 Another nearby hotspot is Clapham High Street.  Again, this area is teeming with bars, restaurants and coffee shops.  Like Brixton, Clapham has a Picture House cinema and both are great places to take in an arty movie or live-streamed opera. Buses from outside Lidl supermarket and Stockwell tube go to Clapham. Omnibus arts centre in Clapham offers good quality, live classical music. \u2022 Also near:",

        "interaction": "If we are not at home during your stay we will be only a phone call or email away should you want to ask us anything. Swift, on-site practical assistance may be possible through our neighbors, local friends and lovely cleaning ladies.       If we are at home you will be warmly welcomed. Having been Londoners for many years we are happy to help advise on how best to see the city - both the famous sights and some of London's more hidden treasures. Normally we would be away during your stay or possibly nearby in London, but we will not typically need access to the flat at all whilst you are here.",

A special request: \u2022 please do not bang the front door. \u2022 The garden is communal to the house and you are welcome to enjoy it.  Please be friendly to neighbors who may be using it also or may be sleeping within earshot. \u2022 We ask that guests would strip the bed and leave the rooms and bathroom in good order at the end of their stay. \u2022 If you are staying we ask you not to have any overnight extra guests, but you are welcome to invite up to 4 guests back for dinner or a meal etc at the flat. If you wish to entertain more than that number we would like to discuss this with you first. \u00a4 One small extra request - please let us know when you've arrived safely at the flat! A quick text would set our minds at rest and mean we can turn our phones off for the night...",

Our shared love of rummaging in antique and vintage shops and buying beautiful furniture (that is not so precious you can't live with it easily) has meant that at our marriage, three years ago, our styles blended well together and our home is a reflection of who we are as a couple.\r\n\r\nAs with our family and friends, we want you to feel at home when you come to stay with us.  We are open and warm.  We enjoy good conversation and getting to know people from all walks of life.\r\n\r\nWe love that our flat is quiet and yet so centrally and beautifully situated.  We can be in the heart of the historic or financial city of London, the Houses of Parliament, Oxford Circus or Chelsea within 25 minutes because we have a choice of two underground lines from our nearest tube, Stockwell Station.",

Although there isn't a single experience I didn't love, the ones that stand out the most are Kenya with my family, doing the GR11 in the Pyrenees, and backpacking across South America on my own for a year and a half.\r\n\r\nI also love the outdoors and any sport in nature: skiing, mountaineering, fishing, and I really want to learn to windsurf this year. I also love cooking and trying new foods. I'm a very independent and self-sufficient person. I love meeting new people especially when backpacking or hitchhiking. \r\n\r\nAlthough I'm only now creating an airbnb account, I've stayed at various apartments with friends through airbnb and everything has always gone really well. As a guest, I like to feel at home where I'm staying but I'm very respectful and always leave the place clean and tidy when I leave. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to airbnb travelling!",

There are several grocery stores and supermarkets (including a large Waitrose and one of the few Whole Foods in London) within easy walking distance as well as a traditional butcher on New King\u2019s Road and a Sunday farmer's market. The area is home to numerous restaurants, including the iconic White Horse pub, a great champagne bar (Amuse Bouche), and London's only Michelin-starred gastropub (The Harwood Arms). New King's Road with its boutiques, restaurants, and antique shops borders the Green and is only a few minutes' walk away. There are several gyms and a cinema nearby.",

Two 24-hour bus routes (14 and 22) stop about a block away (key if you like late nights out, as the Tube shuts down shortly after midnight!).",

I visit every year to do teacher training and enjoy some winter sun.\n In my spare time I like walking pilates, swimming, playing Bridge and meeting up with friends for dinner.\r\n \r\nI can speak basic Greek, French and Spanish (much better at reading than speaking )\r\nJohn is fluent in French.",

I visit every year to do teacher training and enjoy some winter sun.\n In my spare time I like walking pilates, swimming, playing Bridge and meeting up with friends for dinner.\r\n \r\nI can speak basic Greek, French and Spanish (much better at reading than speaking )\r\nJohn is fluent in French.",
